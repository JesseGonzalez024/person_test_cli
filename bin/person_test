PersonTest.new.call

# the idea is to have a class call CLI that can instantiate and calla method on it and shoukd be all we need o start program
# bin/person_test loads main 'lib' of 'lib/person_test'
# this file serves as an execution point/ "executable"
# this is the file people are running
# anything that needs an environment utalize the 'require lib/person_test'
